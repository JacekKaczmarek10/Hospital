# Hospital
Java web application in Spring and Hibernate frameworks.

This project only provides Http methods(GET,POST,PUT,DELETE).

How to run this:

Import sql files to database e.g MySQL Workbench.

(here is example how to do that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvul-wr-_Bg)

Import project as maven project to IDE e.g Eclipse.

Run imported project on server.

Now you should be able to use Http methods from project.

e.g GET http://localhost:8080/spring-hospital-rest/api/patients

This method displays all patients from database.
